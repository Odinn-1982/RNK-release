# Assets Directory

This folder should contain visual assets for the Unhallowed Metropolis system.

## Required Textures

- `textures/paper-dark.png` - Dark textured paper background for sheets (optional - system works without it)

## Suggested Assets

You can add:

- Token frames
- Custom icons for item types
- Background textures for character sheets
- Logo/banner images

The CSS references `assets/textures/paper-dark.png` for the sheet background. If this file doesn't exist, the sheet will still work with a solid color fallback.
